## Netlify setup for auto build

### Changing build setting
Including python process to scraping latest data on build, add `netlify.toml` at root to override netlify setting.

```sh
[build]
  command = "python get_hkgeo-data.py && npm run build"
  publish = "build"

[context.production]
  environment = { PYTHON_VERSION = "3.8" }
```
### Config daily rebuild
1. Create `Build hooks` netlify site setting, then you will have a post url link for trigger build.

   > Settings > Build & Deploy > Continuous Deployment > Build hooks

2. Create daily webhook job at https://ifttt.com/
